## Ragequit
What happens to the boss after the Hero passes through? Can you keep the player from advancing, or will your patience run out first? In “Ragequit” you play as Ravelord Beato and stop the endless barrage of Heroes.

“Welcome back, Ravelord Beato! Another day, another hero to beat so hard that they throw their controllers and ragequit. Most heroes are quite impatient and give up after only three tries. Use the WASD or arrow keys to move and the X, C and V buttons for abilities. The X button lets you do a powerful bonk with your glowstick. The C button spawns a horde of your minions, which you can push into the hero to make them explode on them 😉 The V button lets you throw your mighty glowstick at the hero. But be warned; the hero is not to be underestimated. The faster you finish your daily quota, the faster you can get back to raving! Good luck 🙂”

The random guy who wanted to come in through our window at night and wasted our time with a not-very-pleasant interaction, including a call to the police.


If the game crashes it is due to the player ragequitting ;)
